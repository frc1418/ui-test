# UI Test
This test must be passed by new UI team members.

This test requires -- and will test -- your proficiency with [HTML/CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web), [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript), and [FRC Dashboard](https://github.com/FRCDashboard/training). Click those links to learn about each.

It is recommended that you figure out how to complete these challenges in advance, before taking the test under supervision of a UI leader for approval.

## Challenges
In order to pass this test, you must do the following under the supervision of a UI team leader:
* Clone the [main FRC Dashboard repository](https://github.com/FRCDashboard/FRCDashboard).
* `cd` into the FRCDashboard directory.
* Install the dependencies.
* Start the application.
* Add a button anywhere on the dashboard to change a NetworkTables value of your choice.
* Add a textbox anywhere on the dashboard to change a NetworkTables value of your choice.
* Make both of those NetworkTables values affect something else on the dashboard (change the color of some text, for example, or change what some text says).
